🎨 WALLPAPERS THAT LEARN YOUR AESTHETIC

Vanderwaals uses on-device AI to learn your unique style and deliver wallpapers you'll love. No endless scrolling—just fresh wallpapers that match your vibe.

✨ HOW IT WORKS

• Auto Mode: Discover wallpapers, AI learns from your feedback
• Personalize Mode: Upload your favorite for instant matches
• Auto-change triggers: Every unlock, hourly, daily, or manual

🤖 INTELLIGENT PERSONALIZATION

Machine learning analyzes your aesthetic through:
• Deep visual features (artistic style & mood via MobileNetV3)
