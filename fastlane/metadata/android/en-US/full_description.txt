🎨 WALLPAPERS THAT LEARN YOUR AESTHETIC

Vanderwaals uses on-device AI to learn your unique style and automatically deliver wallpapers you'll love. No endless scrolling, no manual browsing—just fresh wallpapers that match your vibe.

✨ HOW IT WORKS

Pick Your Starting Point
• Auto Mode: Start fresh, discover wallpapers
• Personalize Mode: Upload a favorite for instant matches

Like What You See
• Tap ❤️ on wallpapers you love
• AI learns from every interaction
• Gets smarter over time

Enjoy Fresh Wallpapers
• Change automatically (hourly, daily, or on unlock)
• Or browse and pick manually
• Always something new that fits your style

🤖 INTELLIGENT PERSONALIZATION

Unlike typical wallpaper galleries, Vanderwaals uses machine learning to understand YOUR aesthetic:

• Deep Visual Features (70%)
  MobileNetV3 neural network analyzes artistic style, composition, and mood

• Color Matching (20%)
  LAB color space for perceptually accurate palette matching

• Category Learning (10%)
  Learns your preferences (minimal, nature, abstract, dark themes, etc.)

The more you use it, the better it gets at predicting what you'll love.

🧠 ADAPTIVE LEARNING

• Exponential Moving Average (EMA)
  Smoothly integrates new preferences without forgetting old ones

• Implicit Feedback
  Learns from wallpaper duration (quick changes = dislike, long = like)

• Smart Exploration
  Occasionally suggests new styles to keep things fresh

• Progressive Improvement
  Balances your original taste with newly discovered preferences
