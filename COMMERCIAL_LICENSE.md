# Commercial License for Vanderwaals

## Dual Licensing Model

Vanderwaals is offered under a **dual licensing model**:

1. **AGPL-3.0** for open-source community use
2. **Commercial License** for proprietary, commercial, or rebranded use

## When You Need a Commercial License

You **MUST** obtain a commercial license if you intend to:

- ✗ Distribute a modified or rebranded version of Vanderwaals
- ✗ Use Vanderwaals code in a proprietary application without disclosing your source code
- ✗ Offer Vanderwaals or derivative works as a commercial service (SaaS, hosted service, etc.)
- ✗ Monetize Vanderwaals through advertising, subscriptions, or paid features
- ✗ Remove, obscure, or modify the original branding, name, or trademark
- ✗ Prevent your users from accessing the complete source code of your modifications

## What AGPL-3.0 Allows (Without Commercial License)

Under the AGPL-3.0 license, you may:

- ✓ Use Vanderwaals for personal, educational, or research purposes
- ✓ Study and modify the source code
- ✓ Contribute improvements back to the project
- ✓ Use Vanderwaals in open-source projects that comply with AGPL-3.0
- ✓ Share the original unmodified app

**However**, any modifications must be shared under AGPL-3.0, and network users must have access to the source code.

## Why Dual Licensing?

This model ensures:

- **Transparency**: The community can audit and improve the code
- **Protection**: Prevents unauthorized commercialization and rebranding
- **Sustainability**: Commercial users support continued development
- **Trust**: Users know exactly how the app works
