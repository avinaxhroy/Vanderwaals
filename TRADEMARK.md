## Requesting Permission

If you need to use the Vanderwaals trademark in a way not covered by permitted uses, please contact:

**Email**: [Your Contact Email]  
**GitHub**: Open an issue at https://github.com/avinaxhroy/Vanderwaals/issues with the tag `trademark-request`

Include:
1. How you plan to use the trademark
2. Context and purpose
3. Duration of use
4. Geographic scope

---

## Enforcement

We take trademark protection seriously. Unauthorized use of the Vanderwaals trademark may result in:

1. Takedown requests to app stores and hosting providers
2. Legal action to protect the trademark
3. Requests to rename or rebrand infringing projects

We prefer to resolve issues amicably. If you're unsure whether your use is permitted, please ask first.

## Why Trademark Protection Matters

Trademark protection ensures:

- **User trust**: Users know they're getting the official app
- **Quality control**: The Vanderwaals name represents a specific standard
- **Prevention of fraud**: Stops malicious actors from distributing fake or harmful versions
- **Community clarity**: Clear distinction between official and unofficial versions

---

## Open Source ≠ Open Trademark

**Important**: The AGPL-3.0 license grants rights to the **source code**, not the trademark. You can use, modify, and distribute the code under AGPL-3.0, but you must rebrand any modified versions.

This is standard practice in open-source projects:
- **Firefox** → Forks must be renamed (e.g., "Waterfox", "Pale Moon")
- **Chrome** → Open-source version is "Chromium"
- **Android** → Modified versions use different branding

---

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether your use of the Vanderwaals name or logo is acceptable, please ask:

- Open an issue: https://github.com/avinaxhroy/Vanderwaals/issues
- Tag it: `trademark-question`

We're happy to clarify and help you comply with trademark guidelines.
