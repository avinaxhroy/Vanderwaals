# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Vanderwaals Individual Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Vanderwaals ("the Project"). To clarify the intellectual property rights in contributions to the Project, and to ensure we can defend the Project if necessary, we require all contributors to sign this Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

By signing this CLA, you agree to the following terms:

---

## 1. Definitions

**"You"** means the individual or legal entity making a Contribution to the Project.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that you intentionally submit to the Project. This includes, but is not limited to, source code, documentation, configuration files, and any other creative works.

**"Submit"** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems.

---

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to Avinash Roy and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license** to:

- Reproduce your Contributions
- Prepare derivative works based on your Contributions
- Publicly display your Contributions
- Publicly perform your Contributions
- Distribute your Contributions and derivative works thereof
- Sublicense any and all of the above rights

This license applies to any and all Contributions you submit to the Project.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to Avinash Roy and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a **perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license** to make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your Contributions alone or by combination of your Contributions with the Project.

---

## 4. Originality of Work

You represent that:

- Each of your Contributions is your original creation
- Your Contributions do not violate any third-party intellectual property rights
- You have the legal right to grant the licenses stated in this CLA
- If your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property you create, you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, or your employer has waived such rights for your Contributions

---

## 5. No Warranty

You provide your Contributions on an **"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND**, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

---

## 6. Notification of Inaccuracies

You agree to notify the Project of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make your representations in this CLA inaccurate in any respect.

---

## 7. Dual Licensing and Commercial Use

You acknowledge and agree that:

- The Project is released under a dual licensing model (AGPL-3.0 for open-source use and a commercial license for proprietary use)
- Avinash Roy retains the right to license your Contributions under any license, including proprietary commercial licenses
- You will not have the right to enforce license violations; only the copyright holder (Avinash Roy) may enforce license terms
- Your Contributions may be used in commercial versions of the Project without additional compensation

---

## 8. Retention of Rights

You retain ownership of the copyright in your Contributions. This CLA does not transfer ownership; it only grants the Project the rights specified above.
