/**
 * Material 3 theming for Vanderwaals UI.
 * 
 * Extends Paperize's existing Material 3 theme with Vanderwaals-specific:
 * - Color schemes (light and dark modes)
 * - Typography customizations
 * - Component theming (cards, buttons, bottom sheets)
 * - Animation specifications
 * 
 * Design principles:
 * - Minimal and clean aesthetic
 * - Wallpaper-first design (UI recedes into background)
 * - High contrast for readability over varied wallpaper backgrounds
 * - Smooth Material 3 transitions and animations
 * 
 * Color palette:
 * - Primary: Derived from Material You dynamic color (wallpaper-based)
 * - Surface: Translucent with blur effect for overlays
 * - On-surface: High contrast white/black depending on mode
 * 
 * Integrates with:
 * - Paperize's existing theme system
 * - Material 3 dynamic color extraction
 * - System dark mode preference
 *
